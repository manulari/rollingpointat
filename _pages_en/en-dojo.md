**A dōjō**, is a hall or place for immersive learning or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts, but has been seen increasingly in other fields. The term literally means "place of the the Way" in Japanese

**More space to learn and dance Contact Improvisation:**

The dojo alternates between the special needs for beginners and advanced dancers. A guided CI training session is followed by a contact jam. An almost 200m2 large gym in the VS Gilgegasse 12, 1090 Wien with perfet wooden floor is available for us as a training room.

**Open level CI-DOJO:** The open level dojos also invite all interested newcomers without any previous knowledge to try out and participate ("Tasting Contact Improvisation). The 1,5h training session is about learning In den 1,5 stündigen CI fundamentals. We will start the jams with an opening round and short guided warm up.

**Advanced CI-DOJO:** The sessions offer a strongly physically oriented movement and contact improvisation training. We will work on deepening the basic principles of the CI, such as the consistent following of the rolling contact point as well as on the specific technique for lifts and partnering sequences such as dancing offbalance/commitment to fall\
center to center rollingpoint of contact \
flying Low/high\
moving with momentum
