**Christian Apschner** is co-founder of the association rollingpoint and has been dancing Contact Improvisation since 1995. His most important teachers hail from the pioneering days of CI, namely Nancy Stark Smith, Daniel Lepkoff, Randy Warshaw, Andrew Harwood, K. J. Holmes, Kirstie Simson and Martin Keogh.

Inspired by his work as practitioner for body work (Trager somatic exploration/movement education, Ortho Bionomy) on the one hand and for forms of movement like Contact Improvisation, Anatomical Release Technique, Aikido and Capoeira on the other he has developed flowing three-dimensional movement sequences (3-D Flow Movement).

Christian is also an active performer. To him dance and performance art are part of an artistic and social life concept, exchange, communication and a welcome opportunity to make the invisible visible. In 2008 his 52 minute solo piece "Mirrors Fallin' Off The Wall" was given its first performance.
