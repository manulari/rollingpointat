#### 3 "Into the Deep" - **Contact Improvisation  advanced**

with **Christian Apschner**\
**wed 18.00 - 20.40**\
Turnsaal VS Einsiedlergasse 7, 1050 Wien

Lets get physical! We create a connection between the athletic and meditative and learn to take weight in a body-friendly way through anatomically good alignment, tonus modulation and the use of momentum. In our learning process we want to find the ability to follow the flow of movement and at the same time to perceive the dance so presently that this flow can directed and redirected in a playful way.
