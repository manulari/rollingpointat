#### **"Contact Flying Skills"** - advanced

**18.+19.1.2025, 10.00-17.00**\
**with Christian Apschner  and support from the rollingpoint team**

This technique-oriented workshop invites CI dancers who would like to engage in flying, falling and acrobatic elements. A main focus of the weekend will be practicing different lifts and jumps and dancing upside down on our hands.

We create a connection between the athletic and meditative and learn to take weight in a body-friendly way through anatomically good alignment, tonus modulation and the use of momentum. In our learning process we want to find the ability to follow the flow of movement and at the same time to perceive the dance so presently that this flow can directed and redirected in a playful way.

A solid basic CI and dance experience as well as good physical and mental fitness are recommended for this workshop.
