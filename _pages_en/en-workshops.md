## Weekend Workshops  01/2023

&nbsp;

#### **"Contact Flying Skills"** - advanced

**sat/sun 14./15.1.2023, 10.00-17.00  (ca 1,5h lunch break)**\
**with Christian Apschner and Lui Springer (support)**

The rollingpoint workshop classic for all CI dancers with sporting ambitions!

This technique-oriented workshop invites CI dancers who would like to engage in flying, falling and acrobatic elements. A main focus of the weekend will be practicing different lifts and jumps and dancing upside down on our hands.

We create a connection between the athletic and meditative and learn to take weight in a body-friendly way through anatomically good alignment, tonus modulation and the use of momentum. In our learning process we want to find the ability to follow the flow of movement and at the same time to perceive the dance so presently that this flow can directed and redirected in a playful way.

A solid basic CI and dance experience as well as good physical and mental fitness are recommended for this workshop.
